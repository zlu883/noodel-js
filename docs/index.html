                    <div class="node">
                        <p>
                            Noodel - which stands for <i>node view model</i> - is a responsive, dynamic user interface for
                            content trees,
                            which you can navigate by just moving up, down, left and right.
                            It offers a new way to present content that is modern, user-friendly, and versatile.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Noodel is currently available as Noodel.js, an open source JavaScript library for use in web
                            projects.

                <div class="node">
                    <h3>What can I use it for?</h3>
                    <div class="node">
                        <p>
                            At the maximum, you can use Noodel to present a full website or app as an interactive
                            content tree. It can be used for virtually anything - from static blogs or wikis, to dynamic
                            apps with
                            complex control flow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the minimum, you can use Noodel like a carousel component that can be plugged into an
                            existing
                            page - for multi-level slideshows or hierachical information.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                <div class="node">
                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <div class="node">
                        <p>
                            Noodel requires you to arrange your content into a tree of nodes, where each node contains a
                            distinct chunk of content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your content tree will be presented on an infinite canvas that you can navigate by simply
                            moving up, down, left and right.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Blocks of content will show or hide as you move through the tree, keeping only the relevant
                            subtree visible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Think of it like an infinite cascade of drop-down menus - but much more elegant and useful.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Why Noodel?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Much of the content we encounter everyday naturally come in tree structures.
                        Trees, however, are difficult to present on a viewing surface. Conventional
                        UI schemes tend to "flatten" trees into linear layouts - the most common offender being
                        long texts with many sections and subsections squashed into a single vertical column.
                        Trying to find the section you want can be an exercise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Usually, this problem is addressed by table of contents and navigation menus. But
                        such components become hard to use on smaller screens and does not
                        scale well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Noodel is a system designed from the ground up that aims to present content in a <i>better</i>
                        way - by integrating navigation with the content itself. As a design-driven and UI-driven
                        concept, its core intent is to make the user experience as great as possible.

                        <p>
                            Noodel is simple and intuitive. Most people immediately understand how it works. It
                            aims to leverage the user's spatial memory for navigation, and reduce clutter and cognitive
                            load.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Noodel's display and navigation mechanism remains identical,
                            regardless of screen size and input method. By reducing the essential controls to 4-way
                            movements,
                            it can be easily adapted to contexts where control ability is limited.

                            to what kind of content you can put in. Nodes can even grow or shrink on-the-fly!

                            Noodel is more than just a static content viewer, although you can certainly use it that
                            way.
                            Noodel provides an extensive API with navigation methods and getters, and allows you to
                            insert, update or delete nodes at any time.

                            Noodel is responsive, interactive and comes with fancy animation effects. It's
                            just cool.

                    <h3>Node</h3>
                    <p>
                        The container for a block of content in Noodel is called a <i>node</i> - just like the one
                        you're
                        looking at right now. Nodes are the basic building blocks for your content tree.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each node contains a unit of content. It can also have one or more ordered child nodes
                        that have their own units of sub-content. This can repeat infinitely to form a tree of any size.
                    </p>
                    <div class="node">
                        <p>
                            Noodel encourages you to break down large blocks of content into smaller
                            chunks, which is generally good for readability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A node should never exceed the size of the viewport - a precondition for node-based
                            navigation.
                        </p>

                        A <i>noodel</i> (i.e. node view model) refers to the whole content tree formed by nodes.

                    <p>
                        If a node has children, it must have exactly 1 child that's <i>active</i>.
                        The descendants of the active child will be shown while the others hidden.

                    <p>
                        This means that, at any given time, only the children of nodes on the lineage
                        of active nodes starting from the root are shown. This tree of visible
                        content is called the <i>active tree</i>.

                            In other words, a branch refers to a node's list of children.
                            Each branch is always associated with a node - the parent node of the branch.

                        The axis on which branches are ordered in the trunk is called the <i>trunk axis</i>.
                        It is horizontal (left to right) by default.

                        The root node is an invisible node that serves as the parent of the topmost branch
                        (i.e. the root of the tree), and always exists.

                        The level refers to the depth of a node (or branch) in the tree. The root node has level 0,
                        its children (and branch) has level 1, and so on.

                            Noodel comes with two stylesheets by default, noodel.css and noodel-default.css.
                            The first stylesheet is a "core" stylesheet that contains the critical styles for
                            Noodel's functioning and needs to be included in all scenarios.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second stylesheet is a theming stylesheet that provides a default grayscale theme
                            and basic CSS transitions for Noodel's visual effects. You can include this stylesheet
                            and add style overrides for customization, or replace it altogether with your
                            own custom theme. See <a href="#styling-summary">Styling</a> for more details.

                            The <i>contentTree</i> is an element selector or array of objects that specifies

                            There are two ways to define the content tree that will be used by a noodel.
                            For sites driven by static HTML templates, you can define the tree via HTML and
                            give the root element to the constructor:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                        <code class="language-html">
                            &lt;div id="noodelDefinition" style="display: none;"&gt;
                                &lt;div class="node"&gt;
                                    &lt;p&gt;My first node&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;div class="node"&gt;
                                    &lt;p&gt;My second node&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;div class="node"&gt;
                                        &lt;p&gt;First child of my second node&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            &lt;div id="noodel"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                            &lt;/script&gt;
                        </code>

                                Noodel will traverse the descendants of the container element and convert
                                all <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code>s with
                                <code class="language-html">class="node"</code> into
                                noodel nodes, keeping the parent-child relationships. Any text or
                                elements inside a node that are not child nodes will be treated as the
                                <i>content</i> of that node, concatenated in the order they appear.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This concatenation preserves the markup of the content elements
                                so you have complete freedom in structuring and styling the content
                                of each node.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Note that the actual DOM nodes in the definition will not be placed into Noodel's element tree. 
                                This means that side effects such as event listeners attached to the nodes will not be carried over.

                            Noodel uses Vue.js internally and hence provides integration with Vue out of the box.
                            Noodel is available as a Vue component, and also allows you to use Vue components
                            as the content for individual nodes.

                            HTML, it is recommended that you use Noodel's <a href="#note-on-builds">Vue-less
                            build</a>, alongside the Vue script used in your main project (Noodel requires Vue V3).
                            This prevents Vue from being included twice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are using Noodel via a bundler, the default entry is the Vue-less build 
                            and the bundler should be able to take care of bundling Vue as a dependency.

                                Noodel only needs Vue's runtime script. But if you need to compile templates in runtime
                                you will need to include Vue's compiler script.

                        <p>
                            Noodel's Vue component is exposed as a static variable on the Noodel class, which can be
                            used like any other Vue components. The way to use it is as follows:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                            <code class="language-js">
                                import Noodel from 'noodel';

                                const NoodelComponent = Noodel.VueComponent;                            
                                const app = new Vue({

                                    data: {
                                        noodel: new Noodel([])
                                    }
                                }).mount("#el");

                                Noodel's Vue component takes a single prop, <i>noodel</i>, which must be the internal state tree
                                of a Noodel instance that you can obtain via <code class="language-js">getState()</code>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is important that you do not modify this state tree yourself, but instead use the API methods
                                provided on the Noodel instance.
                            </p>

                                You are not required to register the Noodel instance as reactive data. However, there is no harm
                                in doing so (like in the example) if it suits how you manage your state in your Vue project.

                            You can pass Vue components as node content and they will be rendered via Vue's dynamic component feature, i.e.

                            To do so, you need to provide an object as node content:

                                JavaScript. If your noodel is defined by an HTML template you still need to
                                set your individual node options programmatically.

                        <h3>Preventing navigation</h3>
                        <p>
                            By default, a noodel responds to four types of user input for navigation:
                            swipe(drag), keyboard, scroll wheel, and tap. Navigation will occur even
                            when such input originates from content elements inside nodes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This behaviour can be undesirable when you have UI elements that should
                            capture those inputs and prevent them from causing navigation, e.g. a slider
                            or a textbox.

                        <h3>Prevention classes</h3>
                        <p>
                            To address this issue, Noodel provides the following "prevention classes" that you can
                            selectively apply to individual elements in your content:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-swipe</code></li>
                            <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-key</code></li>
                            <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-wheel</code></li>
                            <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-tap</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Noodel will ignore the input that originates from an element (or its descendants) with
                            the corresponding prevention class and stops it from triggering any Noodel-specific
                            behaviour.

                        <p>
                            You should use prevention classes sparingly, on elements that really need them. Having large
                            blocks of content with navigation prevention may impact usability, especially on smaller screens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For situations that require extensive navigation prevention, you should rely on the 
                            <a href="#inspect-mode-summary">inspect mode</a>
                            instead. Alternatively, you can disable the corresponding input in Noodel's options and
                            provide your own means of navigation via Noodel's API.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Summary</h3>
                        <p>
                            For swipe-based interfaces such as Noodel, there is always an unresolvable conflict between
                            the swipe mechanism and native conveniences that depend on the same motion, such as text selection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <i>inspect mode</i> is the solution Noodel offers to address this issue. By default,
                            text selection is disabled on a noodel and all input directed towards navigation. 
                            Once inspect mode is on, all navigation methods will
                            be suspended and the user is free to select text or perform other conflicting interactions
                            e.g. drag-and-drop in the focal node.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is recommended that you rely on inspect mode, in addition to <a
                                href="#prevention-class">prevention classes</a>, to deal with situations
                            where UI elements in your content conflict with Noodel's mechanism.

                        <h3>Inspect mode trigger</h3>
                        <p>
                            The default trigger for inspect mode is the double tap (on any area of the noodel), or the
                            Enter key on a keyboard.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This trigger has be chosen for maximum convenience and device compatibility, but like
                            anything else it does end up conflicting
                            with interactions such as multiple clicks to select a word/line. If you wish to prevent the
                            default trigger you can
                            always disable it through Noodel's options and provide your own means of toggling inspect
                            mode (e.g a custom button) via Noodel's API.

                        <p>
                            The inspect mode is also used for viewing overflow content in nodes.
                            Scrolling inside nodes is disabled normally but enabled during inspect mode.

                                Noodel is based on the principle of content chunking. Because
                                each node has a limited space, as a general rule, you should try to break down
                                large blocks of content into bite-sized pieces that can fit into individual nodes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, this can be impractical in many situations, so inspect mode is provided as a
                                fallback for viewing overflow content.

                            The object instance you get when you create a noodel is its "view model". You
                            can also obtain the view model of individual nodes via methods on the noodel
                            instance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These view models have 2-way sync with the view, and provide extensive API 
                            methods for you to dynamically update almost every aspect of the content tree.

                                Each view model of a node is uniquely associated with a node in the tree.
                                This means you can do things such as compare the equality of two nodes by simply
                                comparing the reference of their view model objects.

                                Noodel will always try to preserve the current focal node during
                                insertion and deletion, if possible. This means
                                that if the current focal node is at index 3, and you insert a node at index 1,
                                the focal node becomes the node at index 4, and no navigation will occur.

                        <p>
                            Noodel has a variety of layout options that, when used in combination, can customize
                            the layout in almost every way you can think of.

                            To use these options fully, you must understand the concepts of the branch axis and
                            the trunk axis, which are used in place of the horizontal and vertical axes depending on the noodel's

                            bottom, and "reverse" the opposite. When the trunk axis is the vertical axis, 
                            "normal" puts nodes from left to right, and "reverse" the opposite.

                            It allows you to specify the distance as a function of the length of the branch or node on their

                            Noodel has a routing capability which is enabled by default. This allows Noodel to control
                            the hash of your URL to sync with the location of the current focal node.
                            It will use the ID of the focal node as the fragment identifier.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This allows you to use the browser's history navigation to jump between nodes, as well
                            as create URL links that target specific nodes in a noodel.

                                If routing is enabled at a noodel's creation, it will check the URL to jump to
                                an initial focal node if its ID is equal to the hash. The sync between the focal node 
                                and the URL hash happens regardless whether the noodel is mounted.

                            Only explicit changes to the URL (e.g. by clicking on a link) will cause a new entry to be pushed to
                            the browser history. Noodel uses

                                target="_blank">history.replaceState()</a>
                            to replace the URL hash as you navigate around the noodel to prevent creating
                            too many unnecessary entries. This includes when you use Noodel's API to navigate.

                                Noodel's API.

                            You should use routing on one noodel per page only (ideally, when you use a single noodel
                            to control a site). Routing behaviour for multiple
                            noodels on the same page is not well defined.

                            The size of nodes are determined in a very simple way - they are placed in a
                            normal block context, so will grow or shrink to fit their content while conforming to the
                            size of siblings, with respect to any CSS height and width properties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This means you can fully control the size of nodes by setting the height, width,
                            max-height,
                            max-width, min-height and min-width properties on the <code
                                class="language-css">nd-node</code>
                            class (or on custom class/styles you provide for individual nodes). You can have either
                            fixed size nodes
                            (by setting a specific width/height) or
                            flexible size nodes (by not setting a specific width/height), and well as using max/min
                            sizes
                            to adapt to a range of situations. In addition, you can style your content
                            and let them influence the size of their node containers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And whenever the size of a node changes, Noodel will automatically align everything so your
                            focal node is always centered at the right position!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By default, nodes only come with a <code class="language-css">max-height: 600px</code>
                            and <code class="language-css">max-width: 800px</code> that matches the default size of the
                            canvas.
                        </p>

                                As an example, it's very easy to use Noodel to create the typical full-page
                                carousel site, with some simple CSS overrides:
