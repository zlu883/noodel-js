                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        Noodel - short for <i>node model</i> - is a 4-way scroll-snap user interface for content trees,
                        which you can navigate by simply moving up, down, left and right.
                        It offers a new way to present content that is clean, intuitive, and adaptable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Noodel is currently available as Noodel.js, an open source JavaScript library for use in web projects. 
                        Powered by the reactive view engine of <a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="noode">
                    <h3>What can I use it for?</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the maximum, you can use Noodel to present a full website or web app as a single, interactive
                        content tree.
                        It can be used for virtually anything - from static blogs and wikis, to dynamic apps with
                        complex control flow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the minimum, Noodel is a component you can plug in to a web page as an interactive viewer for
                        hierarchical information.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="noode">
                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>
                        Noodel requires you to arrange your content into a tree of nodes, where each node contains a
                        distinct chunk of content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your content tree will be presented on an infinite canvas that you can navigate by simply
                        moving up, down, left and right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Blocks of content will show or hide as you move through the tree, keeping only the relevant
                        subtree visible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's like an infinite cascade of drop-down menus - but much more elegant and useful.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="noode">
                    <h3>Why Noodel?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Much of the content we encounter everyday naturally comes in tree structures.
                        Trees, however, are difficult to present on a viewing surface. Conventional
                        UI schemes tend to "flatten" trees into linear layouts - the most common offender being
                        long texts with many sections and subsections squashed into a single vertical column.
                        Trying to find the section you want can be an exercise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is sometimes helped by tables of contents and navigation menus. But
                        such components become hard to use on smaller screens and does not
                        scale well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Noodel is a system designed from the ground up that aims to present content in a <i>better</i>
                        way - by integrating navigation with the content itself. It is optimized for tree structures,
                        with a lot of
                        considerations thrown in to make the user experience as great as possible.

                            <b>Noodel is clean and intuitive.</b> Most people immediately understand how it works. It
                            reduces clutter and
                            cognitive load by encouraging the removal of navigation bars and menus.

                            <b>Noodel is device-agnostic.</b> Its layout and navigation mechanism remains identical,
                            regardless of screen size and input method.

                            <b>Noodel is accessible.</b> By reducing the essential controls to 4-way movements,
                            it can be easily adapted to contexts where control ability is limited. It is entirely
                            possible to build a Noodel site that
                            operates on just 4 arrow keys.

                            you like.
                            It doesn't care what you put into each node. The look-and-feel is fully customizable via
                            plain CSS.

                            certainly use it that way.
                            You can add, update or delete nodes at any time to deal with asynchronous data or manage
                            control flow.

                    <h3>Noode</h3>
                    <p>
                        The container for a content node in Noodel is called a <i>noode</i> - just like the one you're
                        looking
                        at right now. Noodes are the basic building blocks for your content tree.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each noode contains a unit of content. It can also have multiple ordered child noodes
                        that have their own unit of sub-content. This can recurse infinitely to form a tree of any size.
                    </p>
                    <div class="noode">
                        <p>
                            Noodel is based on the principle of breaking down large blocks of content into bite-sized
                            chunks.
                            A noode should never exceed the size of the viewport - a precondition for node-based
                            navigation.

                        A <i>noodel</i> (i.e. node model) refers to the whole content tree formed by noodes (nodes).

                    <p>
                        If a noode has children, it must have exactly 1 child that's <i>active</i>.
                        The descendents of the active child will be shown while the others hidden.

                        of active noodes starting from the root are shown. This tree of visible

                                Noodel comes in two versions, noodel-full.umd.js and noodel.umd.js. The difference is
                                that the
                                full version comes bundled with Vue.js and the base version doesn't.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you use the base version you need to also include Vue.js dependencies for Noodel to
                                work.
                                This prevents including Vue twice if you use Noodel in a Vue project. See <a

                            There are two ways to define the content tree that will be used by a noodel.
                            For sites driven by static HTML templates, you can define the tree via HTML and
                            give the container element to the constructor:
                        </p>

                        <code class="language-html">

                                &lt;div class="noode"&gt;
                                    &lt;p&gt;My second noode&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;div class="noode"&gt;

                                Noodel will traverse the descendents of the container element and convert
                                all <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code>s with
                                <code class="language-html">class="noode"</code> into
                                noodes of the noodel, keeping all parent-child relationships. Any text or
                                elements inside a noode that are not child noodes will be treated as the
                                <i>content</i> of that noode, concatenated in the order they appear.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This concatenation preserves the markup of content elements
                                so you have complete freedom in structuring and styling the content
                                of each noode. Note this does not apply
                                to the <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code>s that serve as
                                placeholders for noodes, as they are not inserted into the final DOM.

                                Also note that the original DOM nodes will not be used in the noodel, as a
                                new DOM subtree will be created for it.
                                This means any side effects such as event listeners attached to the original
                                nodes will not be preserved.

                                By mounting a noodel on the container of the original DOM tree (as in the example),
                                the original tree will be destroyed and replaced by that of the noodel. This is usually
                                the behavior you want.

                            Noodel uses Vue internally and therefore provides integration with Vue out of the box.
                            Noodel is available as a Vue component, and also allows you to use Vue components
                            as the content for individual noodes.

                        <h3>Using the base build</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you are including Noodel and Vue's scripts directly in your
                            HTML, it is recommended you use Noodel's <a href="#note-on-builds">base ("Vue-less")
                                build</a>,
                            alongside the Vue build used in your main project (Noodel requires Vue ^2.6.11).
                            This prevents Vue from being included twice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are using Noodel as a module
                            from npm, the default entry is the base build and the bundler should be able to load Vue as
                            a dependency.

                                Noodel only needs Vue's runtime build. But if you need to compile templates in runtime
                                you should include
                                Vue's compiler as appropriate.

                        <p>
                            By default, a noodel responds to four types of user input for navigation:
                            swipe/drag, keyboard, scroll wheel, and tap. Navigation will occur even
                            when such input originates from content elements inside noodes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This behaviour can be undesirable in situations when you have UI elements that should
                            capture those inputs and prevent them from causing navigation, for example a slider
                            or a textbox.

                        <h3>Prevention classes</h3>
                        <p>
                            To address this issue, Noodel provides the following "prevention classes" that you can
                            selectively apply to individual elements in your content:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-swipe</code></li>
                            <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-key</code></li>
                            <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-wheel</code></li>
                            <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-tap</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Noodel will ignore the input that originates from an element (or its descendents) with
                            the corresponding prevention class and stops it from triggering any Noodel-specific
                            behaviour.

                        <h3>Caveat</h3>
                        <p>
                            You should use prevention classes sparingly, on elements that really need them. Having large
                            blocks
                            of content with navigation prevention can impact usability, especially on smaller screens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For situations that require extensive navigation prevention, you should rely on the <a
                                href="#inspect-mode-summary">inspect mode</a>
                            instead. Alternatively, you can disable the corresponding input in Noodel's options and
                            provide your
                            own means of navigation via Noodel's API.

                    <div class="noode" data-id="inspect-mode-summary">
                        <h3>Summary</h3>
                        <p>
                            For swipe-based interfaces such as Noodel, there is always an unresolvable conflict between
                            the swipe
                            mechanism and native conveniences that depend on the same motion, such as text selection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <i>inspect mode</i> is the solution Noodel offers to address this issue. By default,
                            text selection is
                            disabled on a noodel and all input directed towards navigation. Once inspect mode is on, all
                            navigation methods will
                            be suspended and the user is free to select text or perform other conflicting interactions
                            such as drag-and-drop
                            on the focal noode.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is recommended that you rely on inspect mode, in addition to <a
                                href="#prevention-class">prevention classes</a>, to deal with situations
                            where UI elements in your content conflict with Noodel's mechanism.

                        <p>
                            The default trigger for inspect mode is the double tap (on any area of the noodel), or the
                            Enter key on a keyboard.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This trigger has be chosen for maximum convenience and device compatibility, but like
                            anything else it does end up conflicting
                            with interactions such as multiple clicks to select a word/line. If you wish to prevent the
                            default trigger you can
                            always disable it through Noodel's options and provide your own means of toggling inspect
                            mode via Noodel's API
                            (e.g a custom button).

                        <p>
                            As of Noodel V2, support for custom scrolling inside noodes has been dropped in favor of
                            using the inspect mode to handle
                            content overflow, which provides a more streamlined viewing experience.
                            Scrolling inside noodes is disabled normally but enabled during inspect mode.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (This allows scrolling to be handled by the browser natively, which is a much better idea.)
                        </p>
                        <div class="noode">
                            <p>
                                Noodel is based on the principle of content chunking. Because
                                each noode has a limited space, as a general rule, you should try to break down
                                large blocks of content into bite-sized pieces that can fit into individual noodes, with
                                responsive styling for
                                different screen sizes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, this can be impractical in some situations, so inspect mode is provided as a
                                fallback
                                for viewing overflow content.

                            The object you get when you create a noodel is its view model. It has 2-way binding
                            with the view, and you can perform operations on it to change the view dynamically.

                                This means you can do things such as compare the equality of two noodes by simply

                                the reference of their Noode instances.

                                Noodel will always try to preserve the current focal noode during
                                insertion and deletion, if possible. This means
                                that if the current focal noode is at index 3, and you insert a noode at index 1,
                                the focal noode becomes the noode at index 4, and no navigation will occur.

                            By default, routing is enabled for your noodel. This allows Noodel to control
                            the hash of your URL to sync with the location of the current focal noode.
                            It will use the ID of the focal noode as the fragment identifier.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This allows you to use the browser's history navigation to jump between noodes, as well
                            as create URL links that target specific noodes in a noodel.

                                If routing is enabled at a noodel's creation, it will check the URL to focus on
                                an initial target noode, if applicable.

                                The sync between the focal noode and the URL hash happens regardless whether the
                                noodel is in view, i.e. the sync will happen even if you programmatically navigate a
                                noodel
                                while it's unmounted.

                            the browser history. Noodel uses

                                target="_blank">history.replaceState()</a>
                            to replace the URL hash as you navigate around the noodel normally to prevent creating
                            too many unnecessary entries. This includes when you use Noodel's API to navigate.

                            Noodel comes with a basic stylesheet that determines the layout, with a simple greyscale
                            theme.
                            You can extend/override most of Noodel's CSS classes to customize various visual features.

                        <h3>Controlling noode size</h3>
                        <p>
                            The size of noodes are determined in a very simple way - they are placed in a
                            normal block context, so will grow or shrink to fit their content while conforming to the
                            size of siblings, with respect to any CSS height and width properties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This means you can fully control the size of noodes by setting the height, width,
                            max-height,
                            max-width, min-height and min-width properties on the <code
                                class="language-css">nd-noode</code>
                            class (or on custom class/styles you provide for individual noodes). You can have either
                            fixed size noodes
                            (by setting a specific width/height) or
                            flexible size noodes (by not setting a specific width/height), and well as using max/min
                            sizes
                            to adapt to a range of situations. In addition, you can style your content
                            and let them influence the size of their noode containers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And whenever the size of a noode changes, Noodel will automatically align everything so your
                            focal noode is always centered at the right position!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By default, noodes only come with a <code class="language-css">max-height: 600px</code>
                            and <code class="language-css">max-width: 800px</code> that matches the default size of the
                            canvas.

                                As an example, it's very easy to use Noodel to create the typical full-page
