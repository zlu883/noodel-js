            <div class="noode">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Noodel, short for <i>node model</i>, is a UI framework for structuring and presenting content in the modern age.
                    It is based on an interaction scheme that is simple, intuitive, and adaptable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently available as Noodel.js, a javascript library. Powered by the reactive view engine of<a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/"> Vue.js</a>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="noode">
                <h3>What can I use it for?</h3>
                <p>
                    At the maximum, Noodel offers a <i>whole new way</i> to structure and present your website or web app
                    that is intuitive and engaging. You can use it for virtually anything - from static blogs and wikis, to dynamic apps with complex control flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the minimum, Noodel is a component you can plug in to an existing web page for an interactive carousel of flexible containers.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="noode">
                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>
                    Noodel requires you to arrange your content into a tree of nodes, where each node contains a distinct
                    chunk of content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your content tree will be presented on an infinite canvas that you can navigate just by
                    moving up, down, left and right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blocks of content will show or hide as you move through the tree, keeping only the relevant
                    subtree visible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's like an infinite cascade of drop-down menus - only much more elegant and useful.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="noode">
                <h3>Why Noodel?</h3>
                <p>
                    Much of the content we encounter everyday naturally comes in tree structures.
                    Trees, however, are difficult to present on a viewing surface. Conventional
                    UI schemes tend to "flatten" trees into linear layouts - the most common offender being
                    long texts with many sections and subsections squashed into a single vertical column.
                    Trying to find the section you want can be an exercise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is sometimes helped by tables of contents and navigation menus. But
                    such components become hard to use on smaller screens and does not
                    scale well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Noodel is a system designed from the ground up that aims to present content in a <i>better</i>
                    way - by providing a user interface that is optimized for content trees, with a lot of
                    considerations thrown in for usability. The result is an intuitive layout that 
                    leverages the spatial memory of the viewer, with an awesome user experience.
                </p>

                <h3>What's so good about it?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Noodel is device-agnostic.</b> The core mechanism and layout remains identical,
                        regardless of screen size and input method.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Noodel is accessible.</b> The core mechanism consists only of moving in 4 directions
                        that can be easily adapted to limited-control contexts. In fact, it is possible to build a Noodel site that
                        operates entirely on 4-direction movements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Noodel is flexible.</b> You can apply its chunking and tree recursion principles for as little or far as you wish.
                        It doesn't care what you put into each node. The look-and-feel is fully customizable via plain CSS. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Noodel is dynamic.</b> It is more than just a static content viewer, although you can certainly use it that way.
                        You can add, update or delete nodes at any time to deal with asynchronous data or manage control flow. 
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="noode">
                <h3>TypeScript support</h3>
                <p>
                    Noodel is completely written in TypeScript, with typing support for its API out-of-the-box :)
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Concepts</h2>
            <div class="noode">
                <h3>Noode</h3>
                <p>
                    The container for a content node in Noodel is called a <i>noode</i> - just like the one you're looking
                    at right now. Noodes are the basic building blocks for your content tree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each noode contains a unit of content. It can also have multiple ordered child noodes
                    that have their own unit of sub-content. This can recurse infinitely to form a tree of any size.
                </p>
                <div class="noode">
                    <p>
                        Noodel's core principle is breaking down large streams of content into bite-sized units.
                        A noode should never exceed the size of the viewport - a precondition for node-based navigation.
                    </p>

                <h3>Noodel</h3>
                <p>
                    A <i>noodel</i> (i.e. node model) refers to the whole content tree formed by noodes (nodes).

            <div class="noode">
                <h3>Active child noode</h3>
                <p>
                    If a noode has children, it must have exactly 1 child that's <i>active</i>.
                    The descendents of the active child will be shown while the others hidden.
                </p>

            <div class="noode">
                <h3>Active tree</h3>
                <p>
                    This means that, at any given time, only the children of noodes on the hierarchy 
                    of active noodes starting from the root are shown. This tree of visible
                    content is called the <i>active tree</i>.

                    It is vertical (top to bottom) by default.

                            Noodel comes in two versions, noodel-full.umd.js and noodel.umd.js. The difference is that the
                            full version comes bundled with Vue.js and the base version doesn't.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you use the base version you need to also include Vue.js dependencies for Noodel to work.
                            This prevents including Vue twice if you use Noodel in a Vue project. See Usage with Vue for more details.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For most other use cases you should use the full version as a standalone library.

                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
                            // Creates a view model based on the given content tree
                            const noodel = new Noodel(root);
                            
                            // Renders the view onto the page
                            noodel.mount("#target");
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        The <i>root</i> parameter is an element selector or object that specifies the root
                        of the content tree, and <i>#target</i> is the target element for placing the noodel.
                    </p>
                    <div class="noode">
                        <p>
                            Mounting will <i>replace</i> the target element with
                            the noodel's DOM elements.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="noode">
                    <h3>Defining content tree via HTML</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are two ways to define the content tree that will be used by a noodel.
                        For sites driven by static HTML templates, you can define the tree via HTML and
                        give its root element to the constructor:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-html">
                            &lt;div id="root" style="display: none;"&gt;
                                &lt;div class="noode"&gt;
                                    &lt;p&gt;My first noode&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div class="noode"&gt;
                                    &lt;p&gt;My second noode&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;div class="noode"&gt;
                                        &lt;p&gt;First child of my second noode&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            &lt;script&gt;
                                const noodel = new Noodel("#root");
                                noodel.mount("#root");
                            &lt;/script&gt;
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <div class="noode">
                        <h3>The specifics</h3>
                        <p>
                            Noodel will traverse the descendents of the root element and convert
                            all <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code>s with 
                            <code class="language-html">class="noode"</code> into
                            noodes of the noodel, keeping all parent-child relationships. Any text or
                            elements inside a noode that are not child noodes will be treated as the
                            <i>content</i> of that noode, concatenated in the order they appear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This contatenation preserves the markup of content elements
                            so you have complete freedom in structuring and styling the content 
                            of each noode. Note this does not apply
                            to the <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code>s that serve as
                            placeholders for noodes, as they are not inserted into the final DOM.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="noode">
                        <h3>Noodel creates its own DOM subtree</h3>
                        <p>
                            Also note that the original DOM nodes will not be used in the noodel, as a
                            new DOM subtree will be created for it.
                            This means any side effects such as event listeners attached to the original
                            nodes will not be preserved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By mounting a noodel on the root of the original DOM tree (as in the example),
                            the original tree will be destroyed and replaced by that of the noodel. This is usually
                            the behavior you want.

                    <h3>Preventing navigation</h3>
                    <p>
                        By default, a noodel responds to four types of user input for navigation:
                        swipe/drag, keyboard, scroll wheel, and tap. Navigation will occur even
                        when such input originates from content elements inside noodes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This behaviour can be undesirable in situations when you have UI elements that should
                        capture those inputs and prevent them from causing navigation, for example a slider
                        or a textbox.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Prevention classes</h3>
                    <p>
                        To address this issue, Noodel provides the following "prevention classes" that you can 
                        selectively apply to individual elements in your content:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-swipe</code></li>
                        <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-key</code></li>
                        <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-wheel</code></li>
                        <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-tap</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Noodel will ignore the input that originates from an element (or its descendents) with
                        the corresponding prevention class and stops it from triggering any Noodel-specific behaviour.

                    <h3>Caveat</h3>
                    <p>
                        You should use prevention classes sparingly, on elements that really need them. Having large blocks
                        of content with navigation prevention can impact usability, especially on smaller screens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For situations that require extensive navigation prevention, you should rely on the inspect mode
                        instead. Alternatively, you can disable the corresponding input in Noodel's options and provide your
                        own means of navigation via Noodel's API.

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        For swipe-based interfaces such as Noodel, there is always an unresolvable conflict between the swipe
                        mechanism and native conveniences that depend on the same motion, such as text selection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <i>inspect mode</i> is the solution Noodel offers to address this issue. By default, text selection is
                        disabled on a noodel and all input directed towards navigation. Once inspect mode is on, all navigation methods will
                        be suspended and the user is free to select text or perform other conflicting interactions such as drag-and-drop
                        on the focal noode.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is recommended that you rely on inspect mode, in addition to prevention classes, to deal with situations
                        where UI elements in your content conflict with Noodel's mechanism.
                    </p>

                <div class="noode">
                    <h3>Inspect mode trigger</h3>
                    <p>
                        The default trigger for inspect mode is the double tap (on any area of the noodel), or the Enter key on a keyboard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This trigger has be chosen for maximum convenience and device compatibility, but like anything else it does end up conflicting
                        with interactions such as multiple clicks to select a word/line. If you wish to prevent the default trigger you can
                        always disable it through Noodel's options and provide your own means of toggling inspect mode via Noodel's API 
                        (e.g a custom button).

                    <h3>Noode content overflow</h3>
                    <p>
                        As of Noodel V2, support for scrolling inside noodes has been dropped in favor of using the inspect mode to handle
                        content overflow, which provides a more streamlined viewing experience. 
                        Scrolling inside noodes is disabled normally but enabled during inspect mode.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This allows scrolling to be handled by the browser natively, which is a MUCH better idea. 
                        ("Don't mess with scrolling!" is a well-known sentiment, after all.)
                    </p>
                    <div class="noode">
                        <p>
                            Noodel's core principle is content chunking. Because
                            each noode has a limited space, as a general rule, you should try to break down
                            long content into bite-sized pieces that can fit into individual noodes, with responsive styling for
                            different screen sizes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, this can become impractical in some situations, so inspect mode is provided as a fallback
                            for viewing overflow content.

                    <p>
                        By default, routing is enabled for your noodel. This allows Noodel to control
                        the hash of your URL to sync with the location of the current focal noode.
                        It will use the ID of the focal noode as the fragment identifier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This allows you to use the browser's history navigation to jump between noodes, as well
                        as create URL links that target specific noodes in a noodel.
                    </p>
                    <div class="noode">
                        <p>
                            If routing is enabled at a noodel's creation, it will check the URL to focus on
                            an initial target noode, if applicable.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="noode">
                        <p>
                            The syncing between the focal noode and the URL hash happens regardless whether the
                            noodel is in view, i.e. syncing will happen even if you programmatically navigate a noodel
                            while it's unmounted.

                    <p>
                        Currently, only explicit changes to the URL will cause a new entry to be pushed to
                        the browser history. Noodel uses 
                        <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState target="_blank">history.replaceState()</a>
                        to replace the URL hash as you navigate around the noodel normally to prevent creating
                        too many unnecessary entries. This includes the use of Noodel's programmatic navigation functions.

                            If you need to do a programmatic navigation that pushes to the history stack, you
                            should manually change the URL hash to point to the target noode instead of using
                            Noodel's navigation functions.

                    <p>
                        You should use routing on only one noodel per page (ideally, when you use a single noodel
                        to control a site). Routing behaviour for multiple
                        noodels on the same page is not well defined.

                    <p>
                        You can control most aspects of Noodel's appearance using plain CSS, by extend/overriding
                        Noodel's CSS classes, or by providing custom class/styles for individual noodes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, you have complete freedom in styling the content inside your noodes
                        since they are just plain HTML. You can combine both approaches for more intensive
                        style customizations.

                    <p>
                        Noodel comes with a simple grayscale theme by default.
                        You can extend/override most of Noodel's CSS classes (see child) to customize basic aspects of the look-and-feel,
                        such as color, background, border and padding.

                    <p>
                        In general, however, you should avoid setting properties that relate to element positioning, e.g.
                        position, box-sizing, margin and transform, as they may interfere with how Noodel layout and
                        moves its elements.

                    <h3>Controlling noode size</h3>
                    <p>
                        The size of noodes are actually determined in a very simple way - they are placed in a
                        block context, so will grow or shrink to fit their content while conforming to the
                        size of siblings, with respect to any CSS height and width properties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means you can fully control the size of noodes by setting the height, width, max-height,
                        max-width, min-height and min-width properties on the <code class="language-css">nd-noode</code>
                        class (or on custom class/styles you provide for the noodes). You can have either fixed size noodes 
                        (by setting a specific width/height) or
                        flexible size noodes (by not setting a specific width/height), and well as using max/min sizes
                        to adapt to a range of situations. In addition, you can set the size of your content element
                        inside a specific noode and let that determine the size of the noode container.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And whenever the size of a noode changes, Noodel will align everything properly so your
                        focal noode is always centered at the right position!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By default, Noodel comes with flexible size noodes with <code class="language-css">max-height: 100vh</code>
                        and <code class="language-css">max-width: 100vw</code>.

                            As an example, it's actually very easy to use Noodel to create the typical full-page
                            carousel site experience, with some simple CSS overrides:

                        the duration and timing functions of all animations via CSS overrides of the following
                        classes:

                        <p>
                            Animation effects during noode insert/delete depend on transitioning the branch

                            functions - otherwise it will cause an odd "jump" in the animations.

                    <h3>Focal change events</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can attach handlers that listen to focal noode/parent change in the noodel,
                        either caused by user interaction or programmatic operations, by setting them in
                        the noodel or noode options. This is useful for triggering various effects as noodes
                        enter/leave focus, for example syncing your own UI elements that indicate focal noode position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note, however, these handlers are called synchronously if triggered by programmatic operations.
                        This means if you call <code class="language-css">moveForward()</code> 3 times in a row
                        to move 3 noodes ahead, focal change handlers will be called 3 times, even though the view
                        only seem to change once. Use <code class="language-css">moveForward(3)</code> or 
                        <code class="language-css">jumpTo()</code> to trigger these events just once.

                    <h3>Scrolling inside noodes</h3>
                    <p>
                        The core principle of Noodel is breaking down content into noodes. Because
                        each noode has a limited space, as a general rule, you should try to break down
                        long form content into bite-sized pieces that can fit into individual noodes.
                        You should also style your content so they do not exeeed their noode containers
                        for your target screen size.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are situations, however, where this is not practical. As such, noodes by default
                        have <code class="language-css">overflow: auto</code>, which means each noode can be
                        a scrollable area by itself. This unfortunately conflicts with Noodel's navigation mechanism,
                        so certain tricks have been applied to make them play nice as much as possible. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This adjusted scrolling behavior comes with some pitfalls, and may not be consistent across browsers and
                        environments. As such, you should avoid overflow content within noodes unless
                        really necessary. If you do have overflow content, you must
                        use the noode container's scrolling context instead of an internal element's to get the adjusted
                        scroll behavior.

                        Currently, all noodes in the same branch must have uniform width 
                        (or trunk-axis size) in order for alignment to work properly.
                        This limitation may be resolved in a future release.
