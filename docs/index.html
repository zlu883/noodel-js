                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Noodel is a view component for presenting beautiful, dynamic content trees. Based on a
                    unique swipe-based design that is simple and intuitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Noodel is incredibly versatile. You can use it as part of your webpage or use it to
                    create and control a full site. As most types of content can be organized into trees,
                    you can use it for blogs, documentation, mindmaps and virtually anything else.
                </p>

                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>
                    Noodel presents your content tree on an infinite canvas that you can navigate just by
                    moving up, down, left and right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blocks of content will show or hide as you move through the tree, keeping only the relevant
                    subtree visible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's like an infinite cascade of drop-down menus - only much more elegant and useful.
                </p>

                <h3>Why Noodel?</h3>
                <p>
                    Much of the content we encounter everyday naturally comes in tree structures.
                    Trees, however, are difficult to present on a viewing surface. Conventional
                    UI schemes tend to "flatten" trees into linear layouts - the most common offender being
                    lengthy vertical documents divided into many sections and subsections.
                    Trying to find the section you want can be an exercise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is sometimes helped by table of contents and navigation menus. But
                    such components occupy precious screen space (especially on mobile devices) and does not
                    scale well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Noodel is a system design from the ground up for presenting content in a <i>better</i>
                    way - by directly integrating content with the navigation mechanism itself. This makes it much
                    easier to find and navigate to the piece of content you want. The whole experience is highly
                    intuitive and human-friendly as it invokes the spatial memory of the viewer.

            <h2>Concepts</h2>
            <div class="noode">
                <h3>Noode</h3>
                <p>
                    The basic unit of content in Noodel is called a <i>noode</i> - just like the one you're looking
                    at right now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Noodes are equivalent to <i>nodes</i> in a content tree.
                    Each noode contains a block of content. It can also have multiple ordered child noodes
                    that have their own blocks of sub-content. This can recurse infinitely to form a tree of any size.
                </p>
                <div class="noode">
                    <p>
                        The basic principle of Noodel is breaking down long form content into individual noodes.
                        A noode should never exceed the size of the viewport - a precondition for noode-based navigation.
                    </p>

            <div class="noode">
                <h3>Noodel</h3>
                <p>
                    A <i>noodel</i> (lower case) refers to a whole content tree formed by noodes.
                </p>

            <div class="noode">
                <h3>Active child noode</h3>
                <p>
                    If a noode has children, it must have exactly 1 child that's <i>active</i>.
                    The descendents of the active child will be shown while the others hidden.
                </p>

                <h3>Active subtree</h3>
                <p>
                    This means that at any given time, only the noodes on the active child path starting
                    from the root is shown. This is called the <i>active subtree</i>.

                    It is vertical (top to bottom) by default.

                    <pre data-prevent-nav-swipe>
                        <code class="language-js">

                    <p>
                        where <i>root</i> is an element selector or object that specifies the root
                        of the content tree, and <i>#target</i> is the target element for mounting the noodel.

                            the noodel's DOM tree. By default, the noodel will expand to
                            100% width and 100% height of its container, so you should specify
                            the size of the parent element to control the noodel's size, e.g.

                            all <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code>s with 
                            <code class="language-html">class="noode"</code> into
                            noodes of the tree, keeping all parent-child relationships. Any text or
                            elements inside a noode that are not child noodes will be treated as the
                            <i>content</i> of that noode, concatenated in the order they appear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This contatenation preserves the markup of content elements
                            so you have complete freedom in structuring and styling the content 
                            of each noode. Note this does not apply
                            to the <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code>s that serve as
                            indicators for noodes, as they will be removed from the final DOM.

                            Also note that the original DOM nodes will not be used in the noodel, as a
                            new DOM subtree will be created for it.
                            This means any side effects such as event listeners attached to the original
                            nodes will not be preserved.

                            By mounting a noodel on the root of the original DOM tree (as in the example),
                            the original tree will be destroyed and replaced by that of the noodel. This is usually
                            the behavior you want.

                    <p>
                        By default, a noodel responds to three types of user input for navigation:
                        swipe (mouse drag), scroll wheel, and arrow keys. Navigation will occur even
                        when such input originates from content elements inside noodes.

                    <p>
                        There are situations where such behavior is not ideal, for example when you have
                        a selectable textarea inside a noode. To prevent navigation behavior from an element,
                        apply <code class="language-html">data-prevent-nav-swipe</code>, 
                        <code class="language-html">data-prevent-nav-wheel</code>,

                        You can control most aspects of Noodel's appearance using plain CSS, by overriding

                    <p>
                        Noodel comes with a simple grayscale theme by default.
                        You can override these CSS classes to customize basic aspects of the look-and-feel,
                        such as color, background, border and padding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In general, however, you should NOT override properties that relate to element positioning and sizing, e.g.
                        height, width, position, box-sizing, margin and transform, as they may interfere with how Noodel layout and
                        moves its elements.

                    <h3>Controlling noode size</h3>
                    <p>
                        The size of noodes are actually determined in a very simple way - they are placed in a
                        block context, so will grow or shrink to fit their content while conforming to the
                        size of its siblings, while respecting any CSS height and width properties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means you can fully control the size of noodes by setting the height, width, max-height,
                        max-width, min-height and min-width properties on the <code class="language-css">nd-noode</code>
                        class. You can have either fixed size noodes (by setting a specific width/height) or
                        flexible size noodes (by not setting a specific width/height), and well as using max/min sizes
                        to adapt to a range of situations. In addition, you can set the size of your content element
                        inside a specific noode and let that determine the size of the noode container.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And whenever the size of a noode changes, Noodel will align everything properly so your
                        focal noode is always centered at the right position!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By default, Noodel comes with flexible size noodes and some basic max/min settings that should
                        adapt to most screen sizes.

                        the duration and timing functions of all animations via CSS overrides of the following
                        classes:

                        <li>any other classes that have transition effects</li>

                        <p>
                            Animation effects during noode insert/delete depend on transitioning the branch
                            and noodes simultaneously. This means they should have identical duration and timing
                            functions - otherwise it will cause an odd "jump" in the animations.

                    <h3>Scrolling inside noodes</h3>
                    <p>
                        The core principle of Noodel is breaking down content into noodes. Because
                        each noode has a limited space, as a general rule, you should try to break down
                        long form content into bite-sized pieces that can fit into individual noodes.
                        You should also style your content so they do not exeeed their noode containers
                        for your target screen size.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are situations, however, where this is not practical. As such, noodes by default
                        have <code class="language-css">overflow: auto</code>, which means each noode can be
                        a scrollable area by itself. This unfortunately conflicts with Noodel's navigation mechanism,
                        so certain tricks have been applied to make them play nice as much as possible. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This adjusted scrolling behavior comes with some pitfalls, and may not be consistent across browsers and
                        environments. As such, you should avoid overflow content within noodes unless
                        really necessary. If you do have overflow content, you must
                        use the noode container's scrolling context instead of an internal element's to get the adjusted
                        scroll behavior.

                        A positive non-zero number that affects how many noodes to snap across after a swipe is released
                        in the branch axis. The final number is calculated as a function of the swipe velocity
                        multiplied by (100 / weight). Defaults to 100.
