# Noodel

Noodel is a UI framework for presenting beautiful, dynamic content trees. Based on an innovative swipe-based design that is simple and intuitive.

Currently available as a javascript library. Powered by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

## What can I use it for?

At the maximum, Noodel offers a *completely new way* to structure and present your website
that is intuitive and interactive. As most types of content can be organized into trees, you can use it for virtually anything - from static blogs and wikis, to dynamic sites with complex structure and flow.

At the minimum, Noodel is a component you can plug in to an existing web page for a touch-responsive carousel of flexible containers, or a full-page slideshow.

## Demo and documentation

So, how does it actually work? 

Well, as the ultimate proof of concept, Noodel uses itself to create and present its own docs ;)
