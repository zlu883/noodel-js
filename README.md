Noodel, short for *node model*, is a 2-dimensional scroll-snap interface for content trees that you can navigate by simply moving up, down, left and right. It offers a new way to present content in the modern age that is intuitive, responsive and accessible.

Currently available as Noodel.js, a JavaScript component for use in web projects.
